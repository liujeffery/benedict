# Benedict: A voice-activated Discord bot.

**Discord calls get hectic. You probably have your hands full doing more important things. Why not use your voice?**

- Performs the features of a typical personal assistant: play songs, look up the weather, or search up that one thing you always forget
- Additional transcription feature to record logs of what you and your friends say in call ðŸ“¸
- Not a fan of voice? All commands can still be activated by text if typing is your preference
